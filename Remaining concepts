Enums=
    -user-defined type that allows you to create a collection of named constant values. It's commonly used to make  your code more readable and manageable, especially when you have to represent a fixed set of possible states or options.
    -Enums are stored as uints internally:
    -The first value has index 0, second 1, and so on.
    -Default value of an enum is the first element.
    -You can use enums inside contracts and structs.

VIEW FUNCTIONS=
    -view functions read state from the blockchain but do not modify it.
    You can access:
     -State variables
     -Global variables like block.timestamp, msg.sender, etc.
    You cannot:
     -Modify state variables
     -Emit events
    Gas Cost:
     -If called externally (via call):Free (no gas cost)
     -If called internally (within contract): consumes gas

PURE FUNCTIONS=
    -pure functions neither read nor write to the blockchain state.
    Only allowed to use:
     -Local variables
     -Function arguments
     -Mathematical operations
    Cannot access:
     -State variables
     -Global variables
    Gas Cost:
     -Externally called: Free
     -Internally called: uses gas

MEMORY=
     -memory is temporary — data stored here only exists during function execution.
     -It is like RAM: fast and short-lived.
     -It is cheaper in terms of gas because it doesn't write to the blockchain.
     Typically used for:
       -Function parameters (especially for strings, arrays, and structs)
       -Temporary variables for calculations or transformations
       -Changes made to data in memory do not affect the contract's permanent state.
       -You must explicitly specify memory when working with reference types like arrays, structs, or strings inside functions.

STORAGE=
    -storage is permanent — data is stored on the blockchain.
    -It is like a hard disk: slower but persistent.
    -It is expensive in terms of gas because writing to storage consumes a lot of gas.
    Used for:
     -State variables
     -Data that should persist after function execution
     -Any changes to storage affect the contract's state permanently.
     -State variables are by default stored in storage.
